# Problem Statement 

We are given data regarding approved and Denied visas for various employers and cities. We want to predict how many visas will be approved so that we can find out the number of  people who will be required to be accomodated in different areas. This data can be used for policy implementation - for future infrastructure projects and city planning in general. This will be our key driver when finding the insights out of the data.
